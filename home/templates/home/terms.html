                    Information on Our Website (<a href="https://devtog-invitations.herokuapp.com/">https://devtog-invitations.herokuapp.com/</a>)
                </p>
                <p>
                    We try to be as accurate as possible with the information we present on the 'INVITATIONS' Properties.
                    We will make reasonable efforts to accurately display the attributes of the products we sell.
                    We do not warrant that product description or other content is accurate, complete, or error-free.
                    Prices and promotions are subject to change and may vary from those offered in our stores.
                    We cannot confirm the availability or price of an item until you place your order. Despite our
                    best efforts, sometimes an item in our catalog may not be available, the offer may have been
                    misstated, or an item may be mispriced. For any of these reasons, we may cancel your order or we
                    may contact you for instructions on the order.
                </p>
                <p>Paying for Your Order - Our site is currently in test-mode, no payments will be taken</p>
                <p>
                    Generally, we’ll charge your payment method for an item when we ship the item to
                    you or confirm its availability in store. However, we may preauthorize your order
                    amount with your credit card, credit account, or debit card issuer at the time you place the
                    order, which may have an effect on your available credit line. When you
                    pre-order with a debit card, we’ll debit your card when you place the
                    pre-order. For special delivery items, we’ll charge your payment method when
                    you confirm a delivery time. For digital items, we’ll charge your payment
                    method when you initiate the download of the product or the product is placed
                    in your account and available for use.

                <p>Order Confirmation</p>
                <p>Our order
                    confirmation to you does not signify our acceptance of your order, nor does it
                    constitute confirmation of our offer to sell. At any time after receipt of your
                    order, we may accept, decline, or place quantity or other limits on your order
                    for any reason. We may impose these limits on a per-person, per-household,
                    per-order, or any other basis. If we reject, limit, or otherwise modify your
                    order, we will attempt to notify you using the email address you provide to us.
                    If we cancel an order or part of an order that we’ve already charged you for,
                    we’ll refund you the full amount of the canceled portion of the order.
