## Offline HTML / JS

This folder contains early work I did on the customising process for the invites.

It was done off-line and not part of my Git, as I was juggling GitPod outages and home schooling, so it was the easiest option at the time.  I have included it here, to show that the HTML/CSS and JS didn't just appear fully complete as it may look in the Git log.
